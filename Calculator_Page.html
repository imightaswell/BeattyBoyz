	<h1>Weight Change and How it Works</h1>
	<!-- A paragrap that explains weight loss -->
	<div>
		<p class="paragraph">
			Weight change in the human body depends on caloric intake. A calorie is a unit of energy used in nutrition<br/> when determining how much energy and nutritional value is in food. The human body uses calories to function<br/> using them for things like providing the engery for our vital organs to operate and providing energy to our muscles<br/> when we walk. Since the human body is constantly working and using calories there’s a base amount of calories<br/> the human body uses (or burns) to ensure our vital organs are functioning properly.<br/><br/>

			An analogy one can use when discussing caloric intake and the human body is gasoline and a car. The major<br/> difference is when humans fill up their metaphorical “gas tank” the energy consumed after is stored within the body.<br/> These stored calories can then be used as a source of energy for the body in the future.<br/><br/>

			Now that a basic understanding of calories and caloric intake is established one can decide if they would like to lose,<br/> maintain, or gain weight. To lose weight a person must consume less calories than their body needs to maintain its<br/>weight and vital body functions. This lowering in caloric consumption is called a caloric deficit. During a caloric deficit<br/> the body prioritizes using consumed calories for vital bodily functions and uses stored calories to run.<br/><br/> 
		
			If a person were to choose to maintain their current body weight then they would need to consume the amount of calories<br/> their body needs to ensure vital bodily functions operate while not forcing the body to tap into stored energy sources. This<br/> level of caloric intake is simply referred to as caloric maintenance.<br/><br/>
		
			Depending on a person’s goals when it comes to fitness they might want to increase their body weight. An increase in<br/> body weight is generally only possible if the person ensures they are eating above their maintenance caloric intake level.<br/> This increase in caloric intake is referred to as caloric surplus. In a caloric surplus the human body first prioritizes vital body<br/> functions, then stores the calories that are supplemental to the maintenance calories in the body.<br/> This storage could either be body fat or muscle.<br/><br/>

			Below is a calculator to determine your caloric maintenance level:
