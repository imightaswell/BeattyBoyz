	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The calf raise is an often ignored excercise but a crucial one. The calf raise targets the gastrocnemius (the large calf muscle) and the soleus (the small calf muscle). If the calf raise is ignored it can cause a serious aesthetic imbalance between the thigh and calves.</p>


	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Step 1: Position yourself on a leg press machine with only the top half of your foot being on the platform ensuring not to lock your knees.<br><br>

	Step 2: Push the platform away from you as if you were going to stand on your toes. Hold this position for about 2 seconds.<br><br>
	
	Step 3: Allow the platform to come towards you by reversing the movement and allowing your foot to make a 80 degree angle with your shin.</p>
