	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The facepull is a very important but also ignored excercise. Facepulls are an isolation movement that activate the rear delts which are a usually ignored muscle. Since they are an isolation movement it is recommended to do facepulls at the end of a workout to allocate energy to compound lifts.</p>


	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Step 1: Standing with your knees slightly bent and feet shoulder width apart grab the rope with an underhand grip, with your thumbs up.<br><br>

	Step 2: Take a few steps back from the tower to extend the cable. Keep a strong athletic stance, activating your core and glutes.<br><br>
	
	Step 3: Squeeze your shoulder blades together to pull the handles of the rope in toward your face. Hold the position for 2 seconds.<br><br>

	Step 4: Return to the starting position, making sure to keep your shoulders up.</p>
