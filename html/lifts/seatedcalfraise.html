	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>The seated calf raise is an often ignored excercise but a crucial one. The seated calf raise targets the soleus (the small calf muscle). If the seated calf raise is ignored it can cause a serious aesthetic imbalance between the thigh and calves.</p>


	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Step 1: Take a seat on the machine and place the balls of your feet on the platform with your toes pointed forward - your heels will naturally hang off. Position the base of quads under the knee pad and allow your hands to rest on top.<br><br>

	Step 2: Extend your ankles and release the safety bar.<br><br>
	
	Step 3: Lower the heels by dorsiflexing the ankles until the calves are fully stretched.<br><br>

	Step 4: Extend the ankles and exhale as you flex the calves.</p>
